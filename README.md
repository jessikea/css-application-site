# CSS-Horiseon-Site

In this CSS project, given a HTML starting code and starting CSS code, I as a programmer was tasked to streamline the code and make it easier to interpret while maintaining its original functions and design. 

## Goals
 Maintain original functions and design of the starting code
1. Ensure that links work and show images when clicked on.
2. Make sure all fonts and images look to be in the same position and same size.
3. Use easily identifiable IDs and classes to distinguish from others and are organized to follow sematic structure.

## What was done
