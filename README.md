# css-application-site

In this CSS project, given a HTML starting code and starting CSS code, I as a programmer was tasked to streamline the code and make it easier to interpret while maintaining its original functions and design. 

## Goals
 Maintain original functions and design of the starting code
1. Ensure that links work and show images when clicked on.
2. Make sure all fonts and images look to be in the same position and same size.
3. Use easily identifiable IDs and classes to distinguish from others and are organized to follow sematic structure.

## What was done

Screencapture of site: 
![he Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page](/classwork/week-1/css-application-site/assets/images/horiseon-html-page-screenshot.jpeg)

Brief summary on what has been changed in CSS:
1. "Benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" were condensed into their shared class, "benefits" and repetitve coding was removed. Specific traits were specified by "div","ul","li","img", or "h#"
2. "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", "social-media-marketing", were condensed into their shared class, "content". Repetitive coding was removed and specific traits were specified by "div","ul","li","img", or "h#"
3. .content images were condensed moved to the classes "float-left' and "float-right" sections.
